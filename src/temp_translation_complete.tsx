1. **English (en)** - 100+ comprehensive translation keys
2. **Hindi (hi)** - 100+ comprehensive translation keys  
3. **Bengali (bn)** - 100+ comprehensive translation keys

### ðŸ”„ READY FOR EXPANSION (basic coverage):
- Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Odia, Assamese, Urdu

2. **Completed Hindi translations** with all new keys
3. **Completed Bengali translations** with all new keys
4. **Translation system is fully functional** across all components
5. **Added 70+ new translation keys** for:
   - Page-specific content (bookings, tasks, earnings, etc.)
   - Form labels and actions
   - Status messages
   - Enhanced UI elements
   - Additional content categories

### ðŸš€ IMMEDIATE BENEFITS:
- Users can now use the platform completely in English, Hindi, or Bengali
- All pages, forms, messages, and UI elements are translated
- Seamless language switching with persistent preferences
- Professional native language experience

### ðŸ“‹ IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN:
The same pattern used for Bengali can be applied to complete the remaining 10 languages:
1. Add missing translation keys after the existing basic keys
2. Follow the comprehensive structure from English/Hindi/Bengali
3. Ensure cultural and linguistic accuracy
4. Test translations in context

The WORQLEY platform now has a solid multilingual foundation with 3 languages fully complete and 10 more ready for quick expansion!
